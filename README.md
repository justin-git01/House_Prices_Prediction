### Kaggle House Prices Prediction

This is my attemp on Kaggle competition on house price prediction, link to the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The qmd report also includes detailed analysis on the data including IDA, EDA, answering a few questions related to the data and fitting method used. The audience can access the report via either html file or opening qmd file and click *'Render'* button.

The predicting result is only in top 50%, further improvement will be made later on.
